# frappe - FRP library for Rust

_(work in progress)_

Functional Reactive Programming library based on [Carboxyl](https://github.com/aepsil0n/carboxyl).
It's designed to efficiently pass objects around by avoiding cloning as much as possible. It also
avoids the complexity of shared data concurrency.
